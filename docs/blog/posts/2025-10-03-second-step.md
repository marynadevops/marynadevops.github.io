Today we:

- Confirmed blog posts work with proper datetime front-matter
- Verified sorting by timestamp (multiple posts/day)
- rss and requirements.txt on ci
- `--cname labuild.moudrick.net`
- `post_date_format: medium`; `yyyy MMM dd, HH:mm`
- `blog_toc: true`

This post completes our first “baseline + blog” experiment.
